Ehcache is an open-source, in-memory caching library for Java applications. It provides a fast, scalable, and reliable caching solution,
allowing developers to improve the performance and scalability of their applications by reducing the load on backend systems.

Here are some key concepts related to Ehcache:

1. **Cache**: A cache is a temporary storage mechanism that stores frequently accessed data in memory. Ehcache provides an implementation of
   a cache that can be used to store key-value pairs.

2. **Cache Manager**: The Cache Manager is responsible for managing one or more caches. It provides methods for creating, accessing, and
   configuring caches. In Ehcache, you typically create a single Cache Manager instance per application.

3. **Cache Configuration**: Cache Configuration specifies the characteristics and behavior of a cache, such as its maximum size,
   time-to-live (TTL), time-to-idle (TTI), eviction policies, etc. Ehcache allows you to configure caches programmatically or through
   configuration files (e.g., XML or YAML).

4. **Cache Entry**: A cache entry represents a key-value pair stored in the cache. It consists of a key that uniquely identifies the entry
   and a value associated with the key.

5. **Cache Operations**: Ehcache provides various operations for interacting with caches, such as putting data into the cache, retrieving
   data from the cache, updating cache entries, and removing entries from the cache.

6. **Cache Eviction**: Cache eviction refers to the process of removing entries from the cache to make room for new entries when the cache
   reaches its maximum size. Ehcache supports different eviction policies, such as LRU (Least Recently Used), LFU (Least Frequently Used),
   FIFO (First In, First Out), etc.

7. **Cache Expiration**: Cache expiration defines the time duration for which an entry remains valid in the cache. Entries that exceed their
   expiration time are considered stale and are removed from the cache during cache access or maintenance.

8. **Cache Events and Listeners**: Ehcache supports cache event notifications, allowing applications to react to cache-related events such
   as entry creation, update, eviction, or removal. Cache listeners can be registered to receive notifications when these events occur.

9. **Cache Statistics**: Ehcache provides comprehensive statistics and metrics for monitoring cache usage, performance, and efficiency.
   Developers can access cache statistics programmatically or through management tools to optimize cache configurations and performance.

Overall, Ehcache offers a robust and flexible caching solution for Java applications, enabling developers to improve application
performance, scalability, and reliability by leveraging in-memory caching capabilities.
